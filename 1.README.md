## 1. 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

### 📝 Description
Use the Titanic dataset to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on available attributes.

### 📌 Goals
- Clean and preprocess data (handle missing age, encode gender/class).
- Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall.

### 📂 Dataset Features
- `PassengerId`, `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`, `Survived`

## 2. 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction

### 📝 Description
This project builds a regression model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like **genre**, **director**, and **actors**. It involves exploring historical movie data, analyzing trends, and estimating ratings given by users or critics.

### 📌 Goals
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values.
- Feature engineering (e.g., encoding genre, director, actors).
- Apply regression techniques (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).
- Visualize the influence of features on movie ratings.

### 📂 Dataset Features
- `Name`, `Year`, `Duration`, `Genre`, `Rating`, `Director`, `Actor 1`, `Actor 2`, `Actor 3`

## 3. 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

### 📝 Description
This classic ML project uses the **Iris dataset**, which contains sepal and petal dimensions of three iris species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. The goal is to classify flowers based on these measurements.

### 📌 Goals
- Load and explore the Iris dataset.
- Train models like KNN, SVM, or Decision Tree.
- Visualize data using scatter plots and pairplots.
- Evaluate classification accuracy.

### 📂 Dataset Features
- `Sepal Length`, `Sepal Width`, `Petal Length`, `Petal Width`
